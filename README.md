## To run the web app

- Access https://ng-the-engineer.github.io/running-tracker/index.html in browser.
- If you fail to load the app, check the [browser compatibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API#browser_compatibility).

- The app requires your permission to retrieve your geolocation.
- No geolocation is collected and sent to any server.

## Development

- The app relies on Mozilla Web Geolocation API.
- Latitude and longitude are the only information available through the API.
